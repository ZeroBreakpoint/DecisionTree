# DecisionTree (C++)

This repository showcases my game implemented in C++ using the Raylib graphics library.  The project demonstrates an agent interacting with a simulated environment using decision-making algorithms.  The game features a **Decision Tree Algorithm** for AI decision-making to fulfill the AIE assessment task requirements.

## Features
- **Decision Tree Algorithm**: Implements robust decision-making logic for the agent's interactions.
- **Real-world Environment Simulation**: Simulates a game-like environment where the agent interacts with its surroundings based on predefined rules and logic.

## Controls
- **Left Click**: Sets the starting node for the player controlled agent.
- **Right Click**: Sets the end nodefor the player controlled agent.
